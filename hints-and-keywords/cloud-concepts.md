| Scaling up/vertical scaling | capacity is increased within the resource, such as increasing processor or memory by resizing a virtual machine | Vertical scaling (scaling up) lets you increase or decrease computing power or databases as needed. |
| Scaling out/horizontal scaling | additional resource instances, such as adding other virtual machines or compute node/scale units | Horizontal scaling (scaling out) entails adding more databases or dividing a large database into smaller nodes, using a data partitioning approach called sharding |
| Elasticity | the ability to shape the resources needed automatically, burst and scale to meet any peak in demand, and return to a normal operating baseline | The ability to dynamically provision and de-provision computer processing, memory, and storage resources to meet changing demands without worrying about capacity planning and engineering for peak usage.

# Types of Clouds
| Type | Description | Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public cloud | a *shared entity (multi-tenant)* computing model. Hardware and resources such as compute, storage, and networking are owned by the cloud provider and shared with other tenants on the platform | *an apartment block*, where you are a tenant that shares the building with other tenants; you pay rent to a landlord for your apartment |
| Private cloud | a *dedicated entity (single-tenant)* computing model. Hardware and resources such as compute, storage, and networking are dedicated to your organization use only | a house as opposed to an apartment block; you are the single tenant, and you do not share the building with any other tenants. You either own the building or you rent the property and pay a landlord |
| Hybrid cloud | a combination of a *shared entity (multi-tenant)* computing model and a *dedicated entity (single-tenant)* computing model | Some computing resources you choose to have running in your private cloud environment and some resources you choose to have running in a public cloud environment based on your needs |
| Azure Dedicated Host |  provides physical virtualization hosts dedicated to individual customers to host their Azure VMs for Windows and Linux workloads | this means that the building and its contents are yours and that you are not sharing with anybody else. This is not a hotel room—this is a house, a single-tenancy occupied building—and each room (or VM) is yours |
