Multiple Choice (optional reversed card)	Practice Assessment for Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals	390	"Your company has to react quickly when cloud services have to rapidly 
allocate and deallocate resources. These resources need to be provided 
on demand via self-service so that vast amounts of computing resources 
can be provisioned in minutes. There will be no manual intervention in 
provisioning or deprovisioning services. Which cloud feature is needed 
in this scenario?"	Agility	"<div><ul><li>You would choose agility. Agility is the ability to react quickly. 
Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. These are 
on-demand services that are provisioned in minutes. There is no manual 
intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services.</li><li>You would not choose elasticity. This feature increases or decreases 
resources as needed, but unlike scalability, elasticity is done 
automatically. Elastic resources are based on the current needs and 
resources are added or removed dynamically to meet those needs, from the
 most advantageous geographic location. A distinction between 
scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.</li><li>You would not choose high availability. This feature allows services 
to run for extended periods, with very little downtime, depending on the
 service.</li><li>You would not choose scalability. This feature can increase 
(scale-up) or decrease (scale-down) resources that are assigned to a 
workload. As demand increases, you can add additional resources or 
capabilities to manage the increase in demand (known as scaling up). 
Scalability does not have to be done automatically.</li></ul></div>

Choose two.	VNet to VNet | ExpressRoute	"<div><ul><li>A local network gateway is an object that represents your local site 
(on-premises location) for routing purposes. In a VNet-to-VNet 
connection, neither end is your on-premises network. A VPN with a 
connection to the on-premises network is the only scenario where you 
need a local network gateway.</li><li>In an ExpressRoute VPN, the connection is between Microsoft services 
and the on-premises network -- direct as a failover of local network gateway</li><li>In a point-to-site VPN, a single user is coinfected to the virtual 
network. Since neither end is the on-premises network, no local network 
gateway is required.</li><li>In a site-to-site VPN, each end is on-premises; for this reason, a local network gateway required.</li></ul></div>
