The cloud service provider is responsible for all facets of infrastructure and application support given there are assurances in place for increased stability and supportability using a mandatory service-level agreement (SLA)	While a cloud service provider is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure (hardware and installation of the operating system for an organization), they are not responsible for application level support.

Practice Assessment for Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals	172	Your organization, a health care practice, is required by law to maintain patient records for seven years. Recently, the organization invested in an electronic health records (EHR) system. The business has been in practice for 18 years and still maintains 5,000+ previous patient files from the past. By law, all these records must be digitized. What type of cloud solution deployment model should the EHR company suggest the health practice implement?	Hybrid cloud	A hybrid cloud is the optimal solution given the health care practice must maintain a public-facing EHR that patients access. However, the practice also maintains internal clinical records and system storage that is being updated as part of the digital modernization project to preserve the paper copies of all 5,000+ patients specific to the practices private cloud instance.  Connecting the public and private cloud instances together offer the  best implementation alternative. Selecting a private cloud exclusively  does not allow patients to access their data, a requirement by law for  those offering EHR systems. By selecting public cloud, the health data  is being exposed to unnecessary parties, violating policies such as  protection of PII and HIPAA. Serverless computing is not applicable in  this case		Public cloud | Private cloud |  Serverless cloud		mc-graw

Which cloud architecture should you include in your suggestion to leadership?	Software as a Service (SaaS)	The organization is looking to reduce as many internal functions as possible, and they are aiming to use enterprise vendor commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. SaaS aligns best with that model. An organization may have some custom applications; however, in this use case, the goal is to shift away from custom and move toward pre-built offerings. The organization may need to procure some IaaS services; however, for this use case, this is not the main objective. Desktop as a Service is not a deployment model.

Practice Assessment for Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals	177	Which of the following as a service types are best aligned with serverless computing?	Platform	Platform as a Service is associated with the development and design of applications. Serverless computing, like PaaS, focuses on the creation of lightweight applications that are event-based functions, set off by a trigger. Serverless applications are fully supported by the cloud service provider except for the application development functionality. IaaS is incorrect as infrastructure alone is not enough to support a serverless environment. It is the underpinning of the serverless capabilities though. SaaS is software delivered by another vendor, a third party; it is not applicable to serverless computing. Database as a service is not a formal architectural option to consider.
